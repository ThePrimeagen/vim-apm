## Vim APM
** UNDER CONSTRUCTION **

Vim APM is a plugin that uses a server to keep track of yoru vim motions (apm)
and your typing speed in insert mode (wpm).  Then we use this to calculate your
total APM and then we compete!

Who is the fastest vimmer?

## Requirements
To store your data and be apart of this you must be a subscriber to
ThePrimeagen's twitch channel.  I will open this up to YouTube / other services
at some point, but for now trying to keep it simple.

## Installation
Don't install it yet, its not ready.
