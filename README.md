### Vim APM

Vim apm keeps track of your APM by counting keystrokes and determining
its worth. You will get both your stroke count / time and your score / time.
The score is based on how frequently you type the same command in normal mode,
where as insert there is only score. Normal mode only keeps track of the last
10 strokes so you are not penalized too heavily

### Getting Started

0. Must use special version of NeoVim (as of right now until its merged). This
   has the required callbacks for this feature to work.
   [This PR](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12536)

1. Use your favorite plugin manager.

```
Plug "ThePrimeagen/vim-apm"
```

2. Set the keystroke callback to on

```
set keystrokecallback
```

3. Execute :VimApm. If you use Ctrl-w o to shut other buffers, you can bring
   back the menu by re-executing :VimApm

4. Execute :VimApmShutdown to stop calculating.

### Values and Meaning

you will see 3 values, n:, i:, and t:. n = normal mode, i = insert, t = total.

There are two numbers Score / Strokes. Score is determined by how repeative the
last 10 commands are in normal mode, not applicable to insert mode. So an
ideal score would be ~1 ratio for normal mode.
