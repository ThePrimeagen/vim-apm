## Vim APM
This is still a very alpha application but should be a good time to use.

### Please file issues for
* anytime you get an error
* absolutely not working
* missing motions or incorrect motions

### Getting Started
Here is my Lazy `config` function.

```lua
local apm = require("vim-apm")

apm:setup({})
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>apm", function() apm:toggle_monitor() end)
```

If you don't know how to install plugins, this is probably not for you in this
moment
